# my-git

This is a **minimal Git-like version control system** implemented in Node.js.  

This is a **custom implementation** of a version control system similar to Git. It includes core Git-like functionalities like initializing a repository, committing objects, storing file snapshots, creating trees, and more. This project is a work in progress that implements basic features of a version control system, such as:

- `init` - Initialize a Git repository structure.
- `cat-file` - View the contents or metadata of Git objects.
- `hash-object` - Compute the hash of an object and store it.
- `ls-tree` - List the contents of a tree object.
- `write-tree` - Create a tree object from the current directory structure.
- `commit-tree` - Commit a tree object with a commit message.
